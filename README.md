SignEase: Interactive Sign Language Learning Platform

🌟 Introduction

SignEase is a web application designed to help beginners learn and practice sign language in a fun and interactive way. Our platform leverages real-time machine learning to recognize hand gestures via a webcam, providing instant feedback and creating an engaging learning experience. The project is a final year project developed to make sign language accessible to a wider audience.

✨ Features

Real-time Sign Recognition: Use your webcam to practice sign language gestures. Our application processes video frames in the browser and sends landmark data to a backend model for a real-time prediction.

Interactive Quiz: Test your knowledge with a multi-choice quiz featuring various signs.

Conversational Chatbot: Get quick answers to your questions about sign language or the application from our integrated chatbot.

User Authentication: A secure login and registration system allows users to track their progress and access personalized features.

Video Uploads: Upload a video to have the application analyze the signs within it.


🚀 Technical Stack

Our project is built with a decoupled, two-service architecture for improved scalability and maintainability.

Frontend
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript: The core building blocks of the user interface.

MediaPipe: A powerful machine learning framework for landmark and gesture recognition, running directly in the browser to ensure low-latency performance.

Node.js / Express: Serves all the static frontend files and manages user sessions and authentication.

EJS: Used for server-side rendering of HTML templates.

Backend (ML API)
Python / Flask: A lightweight web server that acts as a dedicated API for machine learning inference.

Scikit-learn: Used to run predictions on our pre-trained sign language classification model.

joblib: A library for efficiently loading our pre-trained machine learning model (model.pkl).

Database
MySQL: A relational database for storing and managing user data, including login credentials and profile information.


📁 Project Architecture

The application is structured into two main services:

Frontend Service (Node.js/Express): This service is responsible for serving all the HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files to the user's browser. It also handles all user-related functionality like login, registration, and profile management.

ML API Service (Python/Flask): This is a separate, dedicated service that only handles machine learning predictions. The frontend sends extracted landmark data to this service via fetch API calls, and the Flask app returns a prediction result.

This separation allows for independent scaling and development of the web interface and the machine learning model.

🛠️ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Git

Node.js & npm

Python 3.8+ & pip

XAMPP

Local Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/peggyftningbao/Sign_recognition_V4.git
cd Sign_recognition_V4
Set up the Frontend Service:

Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontend

Install Node.js dependencies: npm install

Start the frontend server: node server.js

This service will typically run on http://localhost:3000.

Set up the Backend Service:

Navigate to the backend directory: cd ../backend

Install Python dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure your model.pkl and feature_names.pkl files are in this directory.

Start the Flask backend server: python server.py

This service will run on http://localhost:5000.

Database Setup:

Set up your MySQL database and configure the connection details in your frontend server.js file.

Access the Application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to start using SignEase.
